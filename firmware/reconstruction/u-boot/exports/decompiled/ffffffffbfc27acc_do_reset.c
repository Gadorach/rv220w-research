 * Interpretation: U-Boot command handler recovered from the command-table record. Name identity is high confidence; detailed semantics follow the reconstructed C, strings and callees.
 * Safety: reconstructed pseudocode is not original Cisco source. Do not replay flash, GPIO, MDIO or switch writes without readback and recovery safeguards.
